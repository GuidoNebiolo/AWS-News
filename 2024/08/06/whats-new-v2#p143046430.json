    "postBody": "Amazon Cognito enhances Advanced Security Features (ASF) to address additional enterprise needs. You now have the option to disallow users from reusing previous passwords, helping you address compliance needs. Additionally, you now have the option to stream security events from ASF to an Amazon S3 bucket, Amazon Kinesis Firehose, or CloudWatch Insights. This allows you to combine ASF events with security signals from other AWS and third-party tools, helping you gain better insights and elevating security.\nAmazon Cognito is a service that makes it simpler to add authentication, authorization, and user management to your web and mobile apps. The service provides authentication for applications with millions of users and supports sign-in with social identity providers such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers via standards such as SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.\nThis new feature is now available as part of Cognito advanced security features in all AWS Regions, except AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.\nTo get started, see the following resources:\nPreventing password reuse documentation page\nExporting Logs documentation page\nAmazon Cognito advanced security features pricing\n",
