    "postBody": "Amazon Lightsail now offers a larger Windows instance bundle with 16 vCPUs and 64 GB memory. The new Windows instance bundle is available with Windows Server operating system (OS) and SQL Server blueprints, for both IPv6-only and dual-stack networking types. You can use the new bundle to run new Windows workloads, or to scale up your existing Windows workloads by creating new instances from snapshots.\nThe new larger Windows instance bundle enables you to run compute- and memory-intensive Windows workloads. This higher performance instance bundle is ideal for general purpose workloads that require ability to handle large spikes in load. You can run web servers, large databases, remote desktop services, active directory services, email servers, enterprise .NET applications, and more using the new bundle. You can use the new bundle to create a pre-configured Windows instance in a few clicks, and connect to it within the Lightsail console using the browser-based RDP client.\nThis new bundle is now available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Lightsail is available.
