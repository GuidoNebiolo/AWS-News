    "postBody": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is announcing an integrated mobile experience for AWS services in the AWS Console Mobile App. AWS customers using the AWS Console Mobile App can now access 16 additional AWS services including AWS Systems Manager, AWS Developer Tools, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, in accordance with their permissions via an integrated mobile web browser experience in the AWS Console Mobile App.\nNow, AWS customers who are on-the-go can use the AWS Console Mobile App exclusively to access a select set of both native and non-natively supported services. Customers benefit from the AWS Console Mobile App's biometric authentication (sign-in), and mobile optimized customer experience. For AWS services not available natively, customers can access the AWS Management Console via an in-app browser where they are deep linked to the relevant service pages without additional authentication, manual navigation, or need to switch from the app to a browser.\nThe Console Mobile App lets users view and manage a select set of resources to stay informed and connected with their AWS resources while on-the-go. The sign in process supports device password managers and biometrics authentication, making access to AWS resources simple, secure, and quick.\nVisit the product page for more information about the Console Mobile App.\n",
