    "postBody": "Today AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) is launching a new capability that allows you to align the TCP idle timeout value of GWLB with clients and target appliances. Using this capability you can now perform uninterrupted stateful inspection and fine tuning of the applications that use long-lived flows, such as financial applications, databases and ERP systems, when using GWLB.\nPrior to this launch, TCP idle timeout was a fixed value of 350 seconds, which could interrupt long-lived traffic flows of some applications. With this launch, you now have the flexibility to configure GWLBâ€™s TCP idle timeout to be a value between 60 seconds and 6000 seconds, with the default remaining at 350 seconds for backward compatibility. This configuration can help reduce interruptions in traffic flows by maintaining target stickiness for the optimal duration based on the needs of your application. You can configure the TCP idle timeout value using the 'tcp.idle_timeout.seconds' listener attribute on your existing and newly created GWLBs.\nThis capability is available in all AWS commercial and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.\nFor more information on how to use this feature, see this AWS blog post and product documentation.\n",
