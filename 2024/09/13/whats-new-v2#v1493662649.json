You can use CloudFormation templates to programmatically deploy Amazon Connect agent statuses in a secure, efficient, and repeatable way, allowing you to ensure consistent configurations. CloudFormation allows you to track changes over time, apply updates in a controlled and automated manner, and includes version controls so you can easy roll back changes if needed.\nCloudFormation support for agent status is available in all AWS regions where Amazon Connect is offered.
