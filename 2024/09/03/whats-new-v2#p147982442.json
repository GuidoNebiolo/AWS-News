    "postBody": "Amazon Connect forecasting, capacity planning, and agent scheduling now includes machine learning (ML) powered intraday forecast capabilities, available within the Amazon Connect Contact Lens dashboards. With intraday forecasts, you receive updates every 15 minutes with predictions for rest-of-day contact volumes, average queue answer time, and average handle time. These forecasts allow you to take proactive actions to improve customer wait time and service level. For example, if contact volume drops below expected levels, contact center managers can use the intraday forecast to predict how long that drop will continue, determine the required staffing levels, and shift the remaining agents into back office work or other higher volume queues.\nThis feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Connect forecasting, capacity planning, and agent scheduling is available. To learn more see the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.\n",
