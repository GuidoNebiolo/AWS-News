    "postBody": "Starting today, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams supports adding a VPC endpoint using AWS PrivateLink that connects through the regional endpoint that has been validated under the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3 program. With this new launch, you can easily use AWS PrivateLink with Kinesis Data Streams for those regulated workloads that require a secure connection using a FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic module.\nFIPS compliant endpoints helps companies contracting with the US federal governments meet the FIPS security requirement to encrypt sensitive data in supported Regions. To create an interface VPC endpoint that connects to a Kinesis Data Streams FIPS endpoint, see using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with Interface VPC Endpoints.\nThis new capability is available in all AWS Regions in the United States, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more about AWS PrivateLink, see accessing AWS services through AWS PrivateLink. To learn more about FIPS 140-3 at AWS, visit FIPS 140-3 Compliance.\n",
