    "postBody": "AWS Elastic Beanstalk now supports dual-stack public service endpoints and dual-stack VPC endpoints, including VPC endpoints integrated with AWS PrivateLink.\nThis capability allows you to configure your Elastic Beanstalk VPC endpoints to accept dual-stack incoming traffic (via IPv6 and IPV4). You can also send requests to the Elastic Beanstalk service using the AWS CLI or the AWS SDK specifying an IPv4 endpoint or a dual-stack endpoint. For a list of public endpoints, see Elastic Beanstalk service endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.\nElastic Beanstalk support for IPv6 and IPv4 dual-stack functionality is available in all of the AWS Commercial Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions that Elastic Beanstalk supports. For a complete list of regions and service offerings, see AWS Regions.\nFor more information about Elastic Beanstalk dual-stack traffic support, see IPV6 support in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide.\n",
