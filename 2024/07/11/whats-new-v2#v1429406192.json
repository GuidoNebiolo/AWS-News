    "postBody": "Today, AWS announces the general availability of Amazon Q Developer’s capability to chat about your AWS account resources. With this capability, you can use natural language prompts to list resources in your AWS account, get specific resource details, and ask about related resources.\nFrom the Amazon Q Developer chat panel in the AWS Management Console, you can ask Q to “list my S3 buckets” or “show my running EC2 instances in us-east-1” and Amazon Q returns a list of resource details, along with a summary. You can ask what Amazon EC2 instances an Amazon CloudWatch alarm is monitoring or ask “what related resources does my ec2 instance <id> have?” and Amazon Q Developer shows attached Amazon EBS volumes, configured Amazon VPCs, and AWS IAM roles for Amazon EC2 instances automatically.\nTo learn more, visit Amazon Q Developer or the documentation.\n",
