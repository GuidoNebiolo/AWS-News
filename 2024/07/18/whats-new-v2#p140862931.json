    "postBody": "Starting today, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) C7i-flex instances that deliver up to 19% better price performance compared to C6i instances, are available in Asia Pacific (Sydney) and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) regions. C7i-flex instances expand the EC2 Flex instances portfolio to provide the easiest way for you to get price performance benefits for a majority of compute intensive workloads. The new instances are powered by the 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable custom processors (Sapphire Rapids) that are available only on AWS, and offer 5% lower prices compared to C7i.\nC7i-flex instances offer the most common sizes, from large to 8xlarge, and are a great first choice for applications that don't fully utilize all compute resources. With C7i-flex instances, you can seamlessly run web and application servers, databases, caches, Apache Kafka, and Elasticsearch, and more. For compute-intensive workloads that need larger instance sizes (up to 192 vCPUs and 384 GiB memory) or continuous high CPU usage, you can leverage C7i instances.\nC7i-flex instances are available in the following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), Europe (Ireland, London, Paris, Spain, Stockholm), Canada (Central), Asia Pacific (Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo), and South America (SÃ£o Paulo).\nTo learn more, visit Amazon EC2 C7i-flex instances.\n",
