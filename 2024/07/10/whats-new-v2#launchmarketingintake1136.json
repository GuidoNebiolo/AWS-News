    "postBody": "Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) today announced Agents for Amazon Bedrock can retain memory across multiple interactions over time, allowing developers to build generative AI applications that seamlessly adapt to user context and preferences, enhancing personalized experiences and automating complex business processes more efficiently.\nBy retaining memory AI assistants remember historical knowledge and learn from user interactions over time. For example, if a user is booking a flight, the application can remember the user's travel preferences for future bookings. This capability is crucial for complex multi-step tasks like insurance claims processing, where continuity and context retention significantly improve the user experience.\nMemory retention is available in all AWS Regions where Claude 3 Sonnet and Haiku models support Agents for Amazon Bedrock.\nLearn more about memory retention on Agents for Amazon Bedrock here.\n",
