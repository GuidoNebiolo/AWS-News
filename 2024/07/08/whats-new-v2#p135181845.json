(AWS) announces new 2024 AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP) data visualizations in Analytics and Insights Dashboards, accessible via AWS Partner Central. AWS Partners with the Migration Competency and in Differentiated or Validation Stages of any Partner Path, can now access these new visualizations.\nPreviously, Partners' realization of their MAP benefit was based on project or milestone completion.
