    "postBody": "AWS announces the general availability of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) R8g instances. These instances are powered by AWS Graviton4 processors and deliver up to 30% better performance compared to AWS Graviton3-based instances. Amazon EC2 R8g instances are ideal for memory-intensive workloads such as databases, in-memory caches, and real-time big data analytics. These instances are built on the AWS Nitro System, which oï¬„oads CPU virtualization, storage, and networking functions to dedicated hardware and software to enhance the performance and security of your workloads.\nAWS Graviton4-based Amazon EC2 instances deliver the best performance and energy efficiency for a broad range of workloads running on Amazon EC2. AWS Graviton4-based R8g instances offer larger instance sizes with up to 3x more vCPU (up to 48xlarge) and memory (up to 1.5TB) than Graviton3-based R7g instances. These instances are up to 30% faster for web applications, 40% faster for databases, and 45% faster for large Java applications compared to AWS Graviton3-based R7g instances. R8g instances are available in 12 different instance sizes, including two bare metal sizes. They offer up to 50 Gbps enhanced networking bandwidth and up to 40 Gbps of bandwidth to the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) networking support is offered on 24xlarge, 48xlarge, and bare metal sizes, and Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) Express support is available on instance sizes larger than 12xlarge. \n",
